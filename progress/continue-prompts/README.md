# Continue-Prompts Triage Manifest

**Generated:** 2026-06-20 (refreshed after S114)  
**Rule:** `worklog.md` is the authoritative state file. When a prompt's claims contradict it, the prompt is marked STALE or DONE — the prompt's *content* is left unchanged per the hard rule above.  
**Status vocabulary:** LIVE | DONE | STALE-superseded-by-\<what\> | MERGED-into-worklog | HALTED-gated-on-\<what\>

---

## Active Prompts (sorted: LIVE → HALTED → STALE → DONE)

> **Hygiene policy (FIRM — Matt, recurring: "two continue prompts is confusing"):** the live dir holds the **ONE actionable next track** — not a menu. DONE/STALE prompts AND parked tracks (gated-on-Matt or lower-priority backlog) all `git mv` to `archive/` (kept, organized, recoverable). A parked track's context lives in `worklog.md` / `working/todos.md`; restore its prompt from `archive/` when it becomes the next thing. Never present multiple co-equal "next" prompts at session close.

| Filename | Date | Track | Status | Recommended Model | Note |
|----------|------|-------|--------|-------------------|------|
| `2026-06-18-causal-arc-execution.md` | 2026-06-18 (restored S110; PIVOTED S112; J3 done S113; AFFC opened S114) | Causal-arc: planned major-arc backlog | **LIVE** | Sonnet 4.6 | **STRATEGY PIVOTED S112** — backlog-driven + dip = post-build check. **AFFC smoke test DONE (S114)** (all 5 AFFC clusters dark; ranked fumble list) + **Cersei's-downfall arc BUILT** (smoke #1 — first AFFC causal arc, layer no longer 100% dark). **NEXT = AFFC #3 Brienne→Lady Stoneheart** (roots at built `red-wedding`); remaining queue #2 Kingsmoot→Euron / #4 Dorne; secondary Q5 (Crag→Jeyne). |

## Archive (`archive/` subfolder — 33 files)

Archive files are **DONE**, **STALE-superseded**, or **PARKED** (gated/backlog — recoverable; restore when next). Summary:

| Group | Files | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `2026-06-20-harvest-pass.md` | 1 file | **DONE S110** — consumed all 28 `working/harvest-queue.md` rows into the graph (quotes/appearance/food/place/object + 1 ADVISES edge + milk-of-poppy retype), fresh-verified 23/24, flipped all rows to `done`. Proved the queue→graph half of the harvest mechanism. The harvest pass is **recurring/on-demand** — re-run when the queue re-accumulates (no standing live prompt; convention in memory `feedback_harvest_queue` + worklog NEXT TRACK). |
| `2026-06-17-causal-edges-and-spark-nodes.md` | 1 file | **DONE S105** — pure-analysis strategy delivered (`working/causal-arc-strategy-2026-06-18.md`) + second smoke-test arc (Bran's fall) built + 4-lens advisory board run. Superseded by the causal-arc-execution live track. |
| `2026-06-16-next-move-decisions.md` | 1 file | **DONE S104** — both remaining decisions resolved: #1 `PRECEDES` ordering edges SHIPPED (174); #2 causal pilot SHIPPED (2 `CAUSES` edges). Superseded by the causal-edges+spark-nodes live track. |
| `2026-06-15-arc-wave1-mint.md` | 1 file | **STALE-superseded-by-chain-as-arc (S106)** — its `event.conspiracy` umbrella-parent model is reversed by the S105/S106 chain-as-arc decision (arcs = causal chains queried via `--causal-chain`, NO parent hubs). Kept for historical reference only; do NOT restore as-is. The Red-Wedding/Joffrey arcs it drafted are now candidates for the chain-as-arc machine. (Prompt body unchanged per the manifest hard rule; staleness tracked here.) See memory `project_narrative_arc_reification`. |
| `2026-06-05-edge-modeling-plate-4-haiku-disposition.md` | 1 file | **PARKED S99** — post-Plate-5 backfill Track B (1,617 Haiku bulk re-bucketing); lower-priority backlog, de-prioritized by S96 dip. Context: `working/todos.md` Track B. |
| `2026-06-15-historical-anchor-wave2.md` | 1 file | **DONE S100** — wave 2 shipped: 4 WO5K hubs attached (siege-of-riverrun/battle-of-the-camps/battle-of-oxcross/melee-at-bitterbridge), +43 edges (21,950→21,993), validated + minted. `siege-of-storms-end` deferred (dup cluster). Wave 3 (deep-lore wiki-only) optional/low. |
| `2026-06-15-script-consolidation.md` | 1 file | **DONE S99** — Session 1 (pacer/orchestration) S98 + Session 2 (archive 30 one-offs/wrappers, `weirwood graph/resolve/refresh` aliasing, README universal-index refresh, design §0 fully BUILT) S99. |
| Stage-4 comention + events + design prompts (2026-05-02 → 2026-06-08) | 10 files | Archived S97 — DONE/STALE (comention deprecated S65; events absorbed into Track B; repo-audit done S92; alias-and-display was a chat export). Incl. the `2026-05-31-events-v2-promotion-chain/` folder. |
| Wiki Pass 2 Stage 1-3 prompts (2026-04-26 to 2026-04-27) | 6 files | DONE — wiki Pass 2 Stages 1-3 shipped (Sessions 20-27; 7,563+ nodes) |
| Tier 3 Pass E Phase 2 (2026-05-01) | 1 file | DONE — Path B promotion campaign complete (S28) |
| Pass 1 remaining books (2026-05-02 to 2026-05-04) | 4 files | DONE — all 5 books 344/344 (S30-S36) |
| Bug fix: chain/race bug (2026-05-04) | 1 file | DONE — extraction pipeline bugs fixed (S33) |
| Post-Pass-1 cleanup + direction (2026-05-06) | 1 file | DONE — cleanup executed; Stage 4 direction set |
| Missing-node backfill / wiki prose backfill (2026-05-12) | 2 files | DONE — node layer confirmed whole (S72 false-alarm resolution) |
| Events Haiku bulk monitor (2026-05-27) | 1 file | DONE — bulk run complete (S80); monitor no longer needed |

## Open thread right now (ONE live track)

**LIVE: `2026-06-18-causal-arc-execution.md`** — 10 AGOT/ASOS arcs + WO5K J3 + the **first AFFC arc (Cersei's downfall,
S114)** all SHIPPED + fresh-subagent-verified. The S114 AFFC smoke test confirmed the whole AFFC/ADWD layer was causally
dark and produced a ranked fumble list (`working/session-results/2026-06-20-affc-smoke.md`). **Next action = build AFFC
#3 Brienne → Lady Stoneheart** (orchestrator's pick — roots at the already-built `red-wedding`, best cross-book join;
~2 mints + 3–4 edges; mind the `brienne-arrested`/`faith-militant-uprising`/`conquest-of-dorne` decoy traps). Remaining
AFFC queue: #2 Kingsmoot→Euron (standalone, mints `death-of-balon` + Euron-wins + retype kingsmoot), #4 Dorne/Myrcella.
Secondary cheap dip Q5 (Crag→Jeyne, ASOS) still queued. Reuse the proven mint machine (research subagent → trim+mint
script → index/alias rebuild → fresh-subagent verify → `--causal-chain` smoke; **paste the harvest snippet + the AFFC
decoy-trap list into each text-reading subagent; use SPACED aliases**). Spec: `working/causal-arc-strategy-2026-06-18.md`;
terms: `reference/narrative-arc-glossary.md`.

*Parked/stale in `archive/` (recoverable, not deleted): arc-wave1-mint (**STALE — parent-hub model superseded by chain-as-arc**; its drafted Red-Wedding/Joffrey arcs are candidates for the chain machine), edge-modeling-plate-4 Track B (backlog).*
*Done & archived (no longer live): causal-edges-and-spark-nodes strategy (S105), next-move-decisions (S104), Track 3 dating leftovers (S102), historical-anchor #9 wave 2 (S100), script-consolidation S1+S2 (S98/S99), Mode 3 dip + graph-cleanup (S96), infobox-merge-ship (S94).*
